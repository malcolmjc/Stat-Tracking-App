# StatTrackingApp
A project that I developed for my friends and I to track stats for dye, a game we often play. Right now its only designed for local usage, but I might try and build a publicly deployable version.

# Technologies
MEAN Stack - MongoDB, Express.js, Angular Frontend, Node.js

# Running the Application
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start` (launches the client application)
3. `npm run start:server` (launches the server)
